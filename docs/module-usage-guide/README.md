# Terraform AWS ARC WAF Module Usage Guide

## Introduction

### Purpose of the Document

This document provides guidelines and instructions for users looking to implement Terraform module for managing WAF
### Module Overview

The [terraform-aws-arc-waf](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-waf) module provides a secure and modular foundation for  managing WAF

### Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have the following:

- AWS credentials configured.
- Terraform installed.
- A working knowledge of AWS WAF

## Getting Started

### Module Source

To use the module in your Terraform configuration, include the following source block:

```hcl
module "waf" {
  source            = "../"
  version           = 1.0.0
  # insert the required variables here
}
```

### Integration with Existing Terraform Configurations

Integrate the module with your existing Terraform mono repo configuration, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new folder in `terraform/` named `waf`.
2. Create the required files, see the [examples](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-waf/tree/main/examples/simple) to base off of.
3. Configure with your backend
  - Create the environment backend configuration file: `config.<environment>.hcl`
    - **region**: Where the backend resides
    - **key**: `<working_directory>/terraform.tfstate`
    - **bucket**: Bucket name where the terraform state will reside
    - **dynamodb_table**: Lock table so there are not duplicate tfplans in the mix
    - **encrypt**: Encrypt all traffic to and from the backend

### Required AWS Permissions

Ensure that the AWS credentials used to execute Terraform have the necessary permissions to set up AWS WAF

## Module Configuration

### Input Variables

For a list of input variables, see the README [Inputs](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-waf?tab=readme-ov-file#inputs) section.

### Output Values

For a list of outputs, see the README [Outputs](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-waf?tab=readme-ov-file#outputs) section.

## Module Usage

### Basic Usage

For basic usage, see the [example](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-waf/tree/main/example) folder.

This example will create:

A Web ACL which acts as a firewall to control traffic to or from a service.

The Web ACL is configured with a default action of block, meaning it will block requests that match any of the conditions in the web_acl_rules variable. 

It also creates an IP set, which is a list of IP addresses from which AWS WAF should allow or block requests.

### Tips and Recommendations

The module focuses on setting up setting up an AWS WAF. Adjust the configuration parameters as needed for your specific use case.
